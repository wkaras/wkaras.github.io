<p class="msonormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It’s
common to hear </font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">C
language aficionados</font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
call C++ a “high overhead” language.  But rarely do you hear a
specific explanation of why.  It’s true that, if you call a member
function in C++, it may not translate into a “call immediate”
instruction.  Whereas in C, a function call (that doesn’t use a
function pointer) </font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>could</i></font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
typically be expected to translate to a “call immediate” machine
instruction.  So does that mean C++ has high overhead?  Consider a
car.  You have to stop occasionally and buy fuel to put in your car. 
You don’t have to do that with a bicycle.  But people (at least in
the </font></font><font face="Arial">US) are not in the habit of
calling their cars “high overhead”.  If A only does as much for
you as B, but A takes more of your time, money or other resources
than B, then A can clearly be called high overhead.  But if A </font><font face="Arial"><i>also</i></font><font face="Arial">
does more for you than B, then things are not so clear.</font></p>
<p class="msonormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Back
in the early 1980’s, the buzzword “object-oriented” seem to be
most often associated with the Smalltalk programming language.  A
major goal of OO (or my sect of the OO religion at least) is greater
reusability of code.  Inheritance was one way code could be reused. 
A new type B could be create by taking an existing type A and adding
stuff to it, and existing code for A could automatically be used for
B.  But more importantly, if two types X and Y had some common set of
operations (with the same names, parameters and “meanings”), then
code that used only this common set of operations could be used with
objects (also known as variables, also known as instances) of either
type X or type Y.  But this flexibility came with a performance price
– in Smalltalk, when a function is called, its address has to be
looked up in a hash table.  C++ (following the example of Simula) did
not want to pay this price, so it made a compromise.  It limited
itself to the first sort of code reuse, using inheritance, to
eliminate the need for looking up called functions in a hash table. 
You can tell a goal is truly important when big sacrifices are made
to reach it, so this shows you that minimizing overhead is an
important goal in the design of C++.</font></font></p>
<p class="msonormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">(When
you can write code that will work for any type sharing an implicit
common interface, as in Smalltalk, the implicit common interface is
often called a “duck type”.  The term comes from the expression
“if it quacks like a duck, it is one”.  Because the effective
definition of the implicit interface to the type that is required in
order to work with the reused code is that the type works with the
reused code.  C++ mostly recuperated the ability to code to an
implicit interface when templates were added to the language.  But
templates have issues and complexities that languages like Smalltalk
</font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">and
Python </font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">don’t
have.  </font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">And
the implicit nature of duck types makes it hard to write correct
code, motivating the addition of </font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>concepts</b></font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
in C++20.</font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">)</font></font></p>
<p class="msonormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
C++, if (non-template) code is going to work on objects of two
different types X and Y, then X and Y need to have a common “base”
class Z.  (“Base” in quotes because Z could be either X or Y.) 
But this is made much less limiting by the mechanism of virtual
member functions.  The common code that works for both X and Y is
interfacing formally with an object of type Z.  But when this common
code invokes one of Z’s member functions/operations, this can
result in code specific to the “real” type of the object, X or Y,
being executed.</font></font></p>
<p class="msonormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">C++,
unlike Smalltalk, allows for multiple base classes (multiple
inheritance).  This has many advantages, because like many good
things, inheritance is a good thing that’s often worth doing more
than once.  But the crucial need for multiple inheritance is to allow
a class to have more shared interfaces.  Multiple inheritance does
add a lot of picayune complexity to C++.  That’s probably why Java
chose a very limited form of multiple inheritance – one inherited
class, but many inherited “interfaces”.A Java interface is a
class that’s all hat and no cattle.  It has member function
prototypes, but no function bodies and no member variables.  This
does eliminate some language complexity (Java does not have virtual
base classes).  But it also limits the use of inheritance as a
mechanism for reusing internal class code, in addition to code that
is not in the class but uses it.</font></font></p>

comment illustrates the cost of a call to a virtual member function. 
Notice there is no hash table to be found.  The cost is more than for
a “normal” function call but it’s not huge.  And note that the
cost is only incurred when the virtual function is called through a
pointer (or reference).  It’s not incurred for the first call to
the member function B::g().  Every base class (that is not also a
derived class) with virtual member functions (and/or virtual base
classes) has the overhead of a hidden pointer to the appropriate “V
struct” (V for virtual).  The “V struct” gets bigger with more
virtual functions, but there is (at most) </font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>one
</i></font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">“V
struct” instance needed per class.  The expression of C++ features
in object code can be clever and tricky.  But it’s not that hard to
get your head around the rough relative cost, in space and execution
time, of using a feature in a particular case.  Using a C++ feature
never gives the compiler a blank check to insert unpredictable
quantities of slow object code, as some seem to fear.</font></font></p>
<p class="msonormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">(Side
note:you will hear the rule of thumb “always make destructors
virtual”.  I think there are even some compilers that will issue a
warning if a destructor isn’t virtual.  This is because, if an
object is allocated using new, then freed by delete with a pointer to
a base class, the base class’s destructor will be called, not the
destructor for the full derived class.  So if there isn’t already
something virtual in the class, think whether you really need, or
want for future safety, to make the destructor virtual and thus incur
the overhead of a hidden pointer in every instance of the class.)</font></font></p>
<p class="msonormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">And
then of course there are templates.  There are lots of good reasons
to be terrified of templates, but using templates does not by itself
cause any performance penalty.  None, zero, zip.  The C macro
processor (in Standard C) conceptually runs after tokenization but
before parsing.  Templates are like macros that run after parsing but
before object code generation.  They are generally </font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>much</i></font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
more convenient to use than equivalent macros.  But often one
encounters some esoteric and picayune rules when using templates, and
even more so when writing them.  C++ compilers have very very painful
error messages for mistakes involving templates.  A C++ compiler is
doing well if its template-related diagnostics are merely very
pain</font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">f</font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">ul.</font></font></p>
<p class="msonormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
C, code is often made reusable by using void pointers.  But this
leads to a lot of casting, and thus to errors that the compiler can’t
detect, and that are hard to diagnose at runtime.  You can rewrite
this code as a template, and all the casting will go away.  But,
problem is, the old C version also resulted in common </font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>object</i></font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
code as well as common source code.  Each time you invoke a template,
like a macro, it effectively takes the code in the template
definition, does the appropriate token substitution, and feeds it all
to the code generator.  Thus there is no sharing of object code. 
Often, it turns out that the best compromise is to use a template or
set of templates to create a thin wrapper for the original C code
with the void pointers.The wrapper will contain all the ugly,
error-prone casting.  The big advantage being, you only have to get
it right once.</font></font></p>
<p class="msonormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
perhaps the most fear-provoking feature in C++is exceptions.  </font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">They
are</font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

in a way that there is no performance penalty if an exception is not
thrown.  The compiler can construct a hash table where the keys are
all the possible return adresses in the executable.  When an
exception is thrown, the destructors of the objects in each stack
frame must be called, up to the stack frame where the exception is
caught.  Each stack frame contains the return address within the
calling function, which is looked up in the aforementioned table. 
The result of the table lookup is a pointer to code that calls the
destructors of the objects that exist in the calling function at the
point of the return address.  So clearly, using exceptions could
potentially bulk up the </font></font><font face="Arial"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>size

an executable a great deal, but not necessarily the execution time.</font></font></p>
